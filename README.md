Follow the instructions on the book

2. Implement by creating a class that contains the following:

Data Structure to store the turtles
Data Structure to store the colors
A public method that contains a loop to iterate through the data structure.
An __str__ method on the class to print out step 6 -- for the turles, what specific information would be useful?
An __init__ method to set the turtles to the data structure
Be sure include error checks and documentation on the read me to utilize the class you create.
 

3. Action Items

Step 17 Extend your program
Step 18 

## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
How can I extend my program, and create a double hexagon pattern?
How can I make use of classes, and incorporate them into my program?
```
#### Description Of The App 
The program I made creates a double-hexagonal pattern with the use of turtle, for loops, and arrays. After that, I used classes to help me modularize the code, and while it had the same output as the original program, my code was a lot cleaner, and systematic. I created data structures for the turtles and the shapes. From there, I iterated through those data structures, which helped generate my pattern. With classes, I could also create a string representation of turtle's shapes and colors, and include error checks.

# Include a video of the result of the code at speed 0 or Fast. Be sure to make it available for me to see.
